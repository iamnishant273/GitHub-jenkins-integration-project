# GitHub-jenkins-integration-project

 
 Goal : Integrate GitHub and Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

 Tools used: Git,GitHub,Jenkins 

 Activities : 
Created a Sample source code on Git (Local Repository) and pushes it onto my GitHub Repository ( remote repo).
Now Created a free style job on Jenkins and configure it as per project requirements. 
linked my GitHub Repository with jenkins and enable poll SCM so that job build can start automatically whenever a new commits pushes on GitHub and this was also project's goal. 
For getting job build status notification,i enabled Email notifications in jenkins job configuration. 
Now whenever a new changes will commit in my source code and pushes it onto GitHub then Jenkins will automatically detect it and start a build.
